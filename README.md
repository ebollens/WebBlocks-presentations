# Nimble and Flexible Framework Design

## Abstract

Frameworks are often approached as an intricate black box that extends the 
native language system. Under this guise, developers are discouraged from 
trying to understand the internals, while they're expected to come in line with 
the framework's way of doing things. But it shouldn't have to be this way!

This talk will pull back the veil and discuss how one can build a 
loosely-coupled, highly-extensible framework that gives developers what they 
want, when they want it, and stays out of their way otherwise. This will be 
motivated by a real-world example where the all-encompassing framework model 
failed the speaker's firm, and it will then dive into patterns that restore 
freedom to developers through an alternate design methodology.

While this talk will center on framework design, many of the principles that 
will be discussed are broadly applicable and helpful in many other contexts.
